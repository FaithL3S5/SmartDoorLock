# SmartDoorLock
A simple smart doorlock program created with Arduino Uno Rev. 3. This project was part of the task needed to complete our Embedded System course. There are 5 people in this team with interchangeable position, but mainly focuses on:
1. MUHAMMAD FARISHANIF WIDYONO (Programming and Device Building)
2. MUHAMMAD FATIH FAHROJI (Schematics and Programming)
3. RACHMAN HANAFI (Device Building and Programming)
4. MUSTOFA (Documentation)
5. ROYHAN (Documentation)

How this device work:
1. Utilizes rfid reader for the lock mechanism to work. 
2. The mechanical part of this lock is moved via solenoid. 
3. There is a piezzo buzzer to inform the user whether or not the rfid device is registered or not. 
4. An ultrasonic sensor detects whether or not there are people in front of the door, if there aren't then the lock will lock automatically after a short delay.
